## 🎮 Game Overview

**Click the Snail** is a super simple, intentionally useless web game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
A cute snail slowly crawls across the screen, and every time you try to click it, it says **"Too slow!"**  
The snail even speeds up after every failed attempt — making it *literally impossible* to win.
